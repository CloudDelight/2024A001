TCP Connection establishment steps

1. The initiating client sents Segment containing an initial sequence value which server as a request to the server 
to begin a communication session

2. Server sends a segment conatining acknowledgement value equal to the recieved sequence value plus 1, also its own 
synchronising sequence number. This value is always one greater than the sequence number as ACK is always the next 
expected Byte/Octet.
This ACK value enables client to tiethe response backto the original segment that it sends to the server

3.Initiating client responds with an ACK value equal to the sequence valueit recieved plus 1.

This completes the process of establishing the connection.

TCP Segment header values (Flag sets)
1. URG - Urgent Pointer Field significant
2. ACK - Acknowledgement feild significant
3. PSH - Push Functions
4. RST - Reset the connection
5. SYN - Syncchronize sequence number
6. FIN - No More Data from sender

TCP Three way hand shake

Client --> SYN (seq = m) --> Server Recieves SYN (Recieves SYN seq = m)

Server send SYN and ACK --> SYN (seq = n) + ACK (ack = m+1) --> Client recieves ACK (Recieved seq = n and ack = m+1)

Client sends ACK --> ACK (n+1) ---> Server reqcieves ACK (n+1)


TCP Session Termination Steps

1. When the client has no more data to send in the stream it send a segment with the FIN flag set.
2. The server sends ACK to acknowledge the reciept of the FIN to terminate the session from client to server
3. The server sends FIN to the cleint to terminate server to client session
4. The client responds with an ACK to acknowledge the FIN from the server
