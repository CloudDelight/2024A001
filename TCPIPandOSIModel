TCP/IP Model

1. This defines the category of functions that must occur for communication to be successfull
2. Open standard - Discussed in public forums and documents in as RFCs - Requests for Communication
3. RFCs contain - Formal specification of data communication protocols and resources that 
describe the use of the protocols

4. Communication Process

Steps
1. Creation of data at the application layer of the originating source end devices
2. Segmentation and encapsulation of data as it passes down the protocol stack on th source end device
3. Generation of data on to the media at Network Access layer of the stack
4. Transportation of data using intermediate devices
5. Reception of data at Network Access layer of the destination end devices
6. Decapsulation and reassemble of data at destination end device
7. Passing this data to the destination application at application layer of the destination end devices.
