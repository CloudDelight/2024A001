Transport Layer

This uses four basic processes

1. Addressing
2. Encapsulation
3. Routing
4. Decapsulation

Network Layer Protocols
1. IPv4
2. IPv6

IPv4 Characteristics

1. Connectionless - No Connection is established before sending the data packets
    Example: Sending a letter to someone without notifying the recipient
    Since IP is connectionless it requires no initial exchange of control information
    Packets arrive at destination in sequence.

IPv4 Packet Headers

1. IP Source Address
2. IP Destination Address
3. Time-To-Live (TTL)
4. Type-of-Service (ToS)
5. Protocol
6. Fragment offset
